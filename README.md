# Funnel_Analysis
Metrocar operates on a platform that utilizes a mobile application to establish a connection between riders and drivers. Acting as an intermediary, Metrocar offers a convenient and easy-to-use platform, enabling seamless communication and streamlining the process of ride-hailing.
The objective of this project was to examine the customer funnel of Metrocar, a ride-sharing application. The aim was to identify potential areas that could benefit from enhancement and optimization.
The stakeholders have asked several business questions that can uncover valuable insights for improving specific areas of the customer funnel. Our task was to conduct a funnel analysis and present the analysis and recommendation. Explain our reason for these recommendations based on insights retrieved from the data.
